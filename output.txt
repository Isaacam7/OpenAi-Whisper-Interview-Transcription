"SPEAKER_02":
" Okay, so the first question I want to ask and here's what's from is how would you describe chronic neck pain to me and do and you can call it you can speak in your own language you can call it something different"

"SPEAKER_01":
" you"

"SPEAKER_02":
" We have a lot of people who are looking for a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get a better way to get"

"SPEAKER_01":
""

"SPEAKER_02":
" We asked him if he could finally wish first. I know."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Mom, it doesn't matter."

"SPEAKER_02":
" How would you describe your chronic neck pain to me? And you can use your own words, you can say it in your own language if you want to."

"SPEAKER_04":
" I'm wearing"

"SPEAKER_03":
""

"SPEAKER_02":
" And do you speak? Sorry."

"SPEAKER_03":
" you"

"SPEAKER_04":
""

"SPEAKER_02":
" That's the question."

"SPEAKER_04":
" I would describe my chronic neck pain as ongoing and really persistent and it doesn't allow me to enjoy my life how it actually want to and hinders me from doing the things that I want to do and that I need to do and is having a huge impact on my life in a negative direction and so it's just something that I'm trying to get help with in any given way that I can."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah, it's so for that. So yeah, it definitely sounds like it's had a very large impact on your life. And do you feel when you go to your general practitioner or you go to doctors, do you feel like they really listen to that experience or what you've just told me or described?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" I feel like when I go to the general practitioners, a lot of times they'll kind of put me in a box. They want me to describe it in like two or three words, like it's sharp, it's painful here and that's it. And then a lot of the times if I'm trying to iterate or get to like a story that I'm trying to explain my pain, they might cut me off multiple times. So they're not getting the full view of what I actually want to say, why it's truly happening and how it's impacting my life. Not like just with the pain but all the relationships and family and everything that it's impacting as well. So I feel like my practitioner, all the, you know, they're developing a solution and trying to be there as much as they can. I get interrupted and not able to share the full scope of what's really going on."

"SPEAKER_02":
" It sounds like a really frustrating experience. And hopefully today, you'll be able to explore more into that without feeling like there's restrictions. Absolutely."

"SPEAKER_04":
" me"

"SPEAKER_02":
" So what are some things that you, since you did mention, you feel like you get put in kind of a box, that you limit to a couple words."

"SPEAKER_00":
" they would make it to a couple of words."

"SPEAKER_03":
" Yeah."

"SPEAKER_02":
" What are some general topics where you can be specific? It's things that you would say to them if you weren't put in that box."

"SPEAKER_04":
" I would tell them how it's impacting my work life. I'm continually, I'm not able to work as long and therefore my, you know, hours aren't as efficient as they need to be and my, you know, the goals I'm supposed to hit aren't being hit because I'm in this pain and it's trickling down to everything else. And so then that also goes into finances and then that trickles into family life and dealing with that. And then just, just day to day. So just all the trickle effects that are really going on is something that I'm not able to like really talk about within, you know, the 10, 15 minutes that I get with my practitioner when I do come in and then go from there since it's such a quick system to get in and out the doctor's office since she has to see a lot of patients per day."

"SPEAKER_00":
" Damn it."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Absolutely. And would you say that because you mentioned life and you mentioned work and things outside of the clinical setting, could you talk to me more about"

"SPEAKER_01":
" And then, yeah."

"SPEAKER_02":
" the life factors that go into your chronic pain, whether that be financial or family or work stress. You could give me like one example, one topic, or..."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Like how it's impacting my work stress or financial situation?"

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah, so either how the stress, how like work has affected your pain or the other way around like how pain has affected your work."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah, how the pain has affected my work. I just can't do as much as I like to be able to do, move around, you know. You know, I have to take a little extra time to get to meetings sometimes, because I know it'll be a little slower if I have to pack my bag, you know, a little more slower than normal people without chronic neck pain would, then that kind of impacts all that time over days and hours, like adds up to, you know, something else that I could be doing. And therefore my performance at work is kind of decreasing. And, you know, you might tell your boss that, tell my boss like, oh, I'm in pain, but they're like, okay. But they don't really know how it's impacting on the day to day, all the minutes adding up. And that's what's really impacting like my work performance. It's not a lack of, you know, wanting to do the work or any of my capabilities. It's just, just the pain is, the adds."

"SPEAKER_00":
" over days."

"SPEAKER_03":
""

"SPEAKER_02":
" That's gonna be my next question is, is your work accommodating at all?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" No, they're very much, I work for like a Fortune 500 company, they're very"

"SPEAKER_02":
""

"SPEAKER_03":
""

"SPEAKER_04":
" corporate, they want the goals to be met so they're not super accommodating. You're just another number to them. So."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah, so would you say you had similar experiences, not only in the workplace, but also in your family life? Or generally is your family accepting of your chronic pain and accommodating?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah, I think my family is very accepting and they know all that it really entails with this chronic. I can't, maybe not all the details, but they know, you know, my kid knows I can't pick"

"SPEAKER_03":
" pig."

"SPEAKER_04":
" you know, her up all the time or, you know, my husband will help out where he can even more. And so it definitely adds more workload to my family more so than it should if I didn't have this pain and I could spend more time with my kids and more time outside, just in general, because I love, you know, to be outside and stuff like that and help my husband out here and there. So I think they are definitely more accepting of it, obviously more so than the workplace, but it does continue to impact it negatively."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah, well it's great to hear that they are accepting of that. Yeah, it definitely..."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah, it definitely, definitely helps."

"SPEAKER_02":
" And a little bit of a shift, but would you mind going a little bit deeper into the impact on your relationships? If there's no impact, then that's fine."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Like I had touched on with the home life, all of that, but also with friends, like it's just harder to, you know, to go out and sit at a dinner or, you know, if I want to, you know, go support my friend, like an art show, you know, for, for instance, I can't really stay there a long time and that might look like, you know, I don't really want to be there, but really I'm, I'm dealing with the pain. So it's definitely hindered some friendships, cause I'm not able to, to show up all the time. Or if I do, then it's not like I can stay for a long time because the pain is, is so overbearing. And so I definitely thinks it impacts it negatively, even though my friends do know that I deal with it. People hear like pain and like, okay, you know, and that chronic pain, like, oh, it's like really bad, but you know, they're not the ones living with it. All they, all they can do is, you know, accept it and try to understand, but you know, being the person who lives with this is kind of tough. So definitely the friendships have been impacted negatively. By the neck pain."

"SPEAKER_03":
" you."

"SPEAKER_00":
" with it, people hear like pain and like, okay, you know, and that chronic pain, like, oh, it's like really bad, but you know, they're not the ones living with it. All they, all they can do is, you know, accept it and try to understand, but."

"SPEAKER_01":
" the neck pain. Do you know anyone else with neck pain? Chronic neck pain? Not."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Not really, maybe if I go to the practitioner, you sit in the doctor's office and be like, oh, what are you in here for? Oh, neck pain. But there's no real community or meetings for people with chronic neck pain because it seems to be just a common thing. So there's no really support for you getting together for other patients."

"SPEAKER_00":
""

"SPEAKER_03":
" you"

"SPEAKER_00":
""

"SPEAKER_03":
""

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk on was like some support."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah."

"SPEAKER_02":
" So what strategies do you use to cope with that? You might be the only person you know with cardiac pain."

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah, I try to, you know, are you talking about physical things or like stretching, exercising or any."

"SPEAKER_02":
" It could be anything more on an emotional level because being the only person you know with chronic knife pain can have an emotional toll on people. I was wondering if there's any emotional strategies you use or do you seek out help from people?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" Not really. I feel like it's just something that, you know, that I live with and I don't see like any like, seek any like emotional help about it or go to, you know, like therapy, like talking therapy or anything about that. So I haven't seeked any emotional help, but it might be something that could look into that, you know, could potentially help. Or, you know, maybe I start my own group for other patients with chronic neck pain so we can talk about our experiences together."

"SPEAKER_00":
" you"

"SPEAKER_03":
" therapy, like talking therapy or anything about that. So I haven't seeked any emotional help, but it might be something that could look into that could potentially help. Or maybe I start my own group."

"SPEAKER_01":
" other patients with chronic neck pain so you can talk about our experiences together."

"SPEAKER_02":
" I'm going to take a look at the other ones. Um... I am noticing a lot of overlap with these questions. Not that I'm asking them. But, um... So, if you don't search out emotional support, um..."

"SPEAKER_03":
" But."

"SPEAKER_02":
" I guess we can go into the physical. Do you have any cultural practices or alternative therapies you use to cope with physical pain or alleviate physical pain?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" Just try to pray. Yeah, sometimes God hears my prayers. So, just hoping he brings me through it. But that's a great question that you ask because, you know, every culture is different. They might have something. So, yeah, just pray time to time. Try to meditate here and there. So, yeah."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Yeah, sometimes when God hears my prayers, so..."

"SPEAKER_03":
" Mm-hmm."

"SPEAKER_02":
" That's awesome. And when you do go to the practitioner, do you feel as."

"SPEAKER_04":
""

"SPEAKER_03":
" Thank you."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Well, let me rephrase it. Are there any experiences where you have become uncomfortable sharing your pain with your doctor practitioner, or do you generally feel comfortable explaining that?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" I feel comfortable. I feel like when I go to my practitioner, because I've been seeing her for a long time for this issue, that we have developed some sort of camaraderie. Well, maybe not camaraderie, but we see each other, you know, pretty often. So it's easy to talk to her and for her to understand just the times where I felt, you know, uncomfortable. Just times like where I get cut off, like here and there, which doesn't allow me to fully explain my whole experience with the chronic pain."

"SPEAKER_02":
" We are."

"SPEAKER_00":
" I'm pretty."

"SPEAKER_02":
" I'm going to shift a little bit to lifestyle. Do you change your plans based on your chronic pain?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah, sometimes I have plans out with friends or family going to my kid's game every so often. And sometimes the pain is just so bad that I can't even really make it out. I can't drive because driving is all shorter and neck. That'll be hard and sometimes hinders the time that I'll show up and try to be on time as much as you can and all that. So definitely."

"SPEAKER_03":
" shoulder and neck. That'll be hard and sometimes hinders."

"SPEAKER_04":
" hinders and all trades plans that I originally had when I knew if I didn't have this pain that I could show up better than I am now."

"SPEAKER_02":
" And"

"SPEAKER_03":
" you"

"SPEAKER_02":
" What about long-term plans? Has your chronic pain stopped you from taking a job, or has it stopped you, or led you in a different direction than you normally would have in terms of bigger things?"

"SPEAKER_04":
" Yeah, I always saw myself, especially when I was younger, being outside all the time and stuff like that. Just maybe like a park ranger, I don't know, just being outside, just doing and continuing to stay active and hike and rock climb and all that. But with this pain, I've just taken a desk job somewhere I can sit down and kind of be with it and still try to stay active in the gym here and there. But I know I'm not doing all that I wanted to do before, I mean, after this happened. So it's definitely altered the long-term goals I had set for myself."

"SPEAKER_03":
" Um."

"SPEAKER_04":
" And so that probably also flares up the pain, that stress and sadness as well."

"SPEAKER_02":
" Sounds pretty disruptive to your life. And if you could pick one thing you can do without your chronic pain."

"SPEAKER_04":
" to your life and if you could pick like one thing you can do without your chronic pain. I just play with my kids you know they're"

"SPEAKER_02":
" We made it so far."

"SPEAKER_04":
" They're so young. You know that too."

"SPEAKER_03":
" you"

"SPEAKER_02":
" Okay."

"SPEAKER_03":
" you"

"SPEAKER_04":
" just wouldn't be"
